![text](../Parser/ConfigParser.cs) what does this file do?
Assistant:
The given `ConfigParser.cs` file is a C# program to parse configuration files. It reads from a key-value format, where each line contains a key and value separated by an `=` symbol. It stores the parsed keys and values in a dictionary object, which can be queried later for specific configuration values.

Here are some key behaviors of this parser:

1. It reads lines from the configuration content, and for each line, it interprets everything before the first `=` symbol as the key and everything after as the value.
2. Both keys and values are trimmed to remove unnecessary leading or trailing whitespaces.
3. It interprets a value starting with `$` as an environment variable. The parser will attempt to replace it with the value stored in the environment under the same name.
4. It saves parsed keys and values into a dictionary with case-insensitive keys.
5. The dictionary is later packaged into a `ProviderConfig` object and returned, which has an `Options` property that stores the key-value pairs.

Please note that this function doesn't handle empty keys properly and it is unable to process values that contain multiple `=` symbols correctly.

For example, if your config file was defined as:
```
database_uri = mongodb://localhost:27017
api_key = $api_key
```
After parsing, the `Options` dictionary of the `ProviderConfig` object would look like this:
```
{
    "database_uri": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
    "api_key": <The actual value stored in "api_key" environment variable>,
}
```
