What are the advantages of using a markdown-like format for AI prompt files?

Using a markdown-like format for AI prompt files offers several advantages:

1. **Human-readable structure**: The format is intuitive and easy to read for humans, making it simple to create and edit prompt files without specialized tools.

2. **Familiar syntax**: Many developers and content creators are already familiar with markdown, so the learning curve is minimal.

3. **Section separation**: Clear delineation between different components (system prompts, user queries, assistant responses) makes it easy to understand the flow of conversation.

4. **Lightweight**: The format is text-based and lightweight, making files easy to store, version control, and share.

5. **Extensibility**: The format can be extended to support additional metadata, configuration options, or specialized content types while maintaining backward compatibility.

6. **Processing efficiency**: Simple parsing requirements mean applications can efficiently process these files with minimal overhead.

7. **Portability**: Being plain text, these files work across all operating systems and text editors without compatibility issues.

8. **Version control friendly**: Changes to the files are easily tracked in version control systems like Git, with meaningful diffs.

This combination of simplicity, familiarity, and flexibility makes markdown-like formats an excellent choice for structured AI prompt files.
