  I'm trying to implement a simple LINQ query to filter a list of objects.
  I have a List<Product> with properties like Name, Price, and Category.
  How can I write a LINQ query that returns all products in the "Electronics" 
  category with a price less than $500?
  
  Here's my Product class:
  ```csharp
  public class Product
  {
      public string Name { get; set; }
      public decimal Price { get; set; }
      public string Category { get; set; }
  }
  ```
